Diabetes Detection Using Machine Learning

Introduction:
Diabetes is usually classified into 2- type 1 and type 2. Diabetes mellitus, which is Type 2 diabetes, is a chronic condition posing significant challenges to global healthcare systems. The increasing prevalence of this disease demands innovative approaches for early detection and effective management. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques offer promising solutions for predicting diabetes. Utilizing extensive datasets, including essential health indicators such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and glucose levels, machine learning models can identify patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes.
Types of Diabetes:
•	When an individual having type 1 diabetes, their immune system is not strong enough and the white blood cells cannot to make enough insulin. There are no convincing studies that demonstrate the 2) causes of type 1 diabetes, and there are also no effective preventative measures till now. 3) Type 2 diabetes is characterised by either insufficient insulin production by the cells or improper insulin use by the body. 90% of people with diabetes have this kind of diabetes, making it the most prevalent type. Both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to its occurrence. 4) Gestational diabetes manifests as in pregnant women who have high blood sugar levels unexpectedly. It will return in two-thirds of patients during consecutive pregnancies. There is a high likelihood that type 1 or type 2 diabetes will develop during a gestational diabetes-affected pregnancy. Diabetes is also caused by genetic conditions, It is caused by at least two defective genes on chromosome 6, the chromosome that controls the body's response to numerous antigens. The incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes may also be influenced by viral infection. Infection with viruses such as rubella, mumps, hepatitis B virus, and cytomegalovirus increase the risk of having diabetes. The goal of this study is to create a system that, by fusing the findings of several machine learning approaches, can more accurately conduct early diabetes prediction for a patient.
 
Technology Stack
The proposed model utilizes the following libraries and technologies:
•	Python 3.8: The primary programming language used for developing the model.
•	Scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library used for implementing classification algorithms.
•	Pandas: A data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
•	NumPy: A numerical computing library used for array operations and data manipulation.
•	Matplotlib: Data visualization libraries used for plotting and visualizing results.


Project Architecture and Workflow
The proposed model follows a structured approach to diabetes detection, involving the following stages:
Data Collection: A dataset of patient records is collected, featuring various diagnostic parameters such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and glucose levels.
•	Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed to ensure consistency and quality.
•	Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted and engineered to improve the model's performance.
•	Model Selection: A combination of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, are evaluated and selected based on their performance. 
•	Model Deployment: The trained model is deployed as a web application, allowing users to input patient data and receive a diabetes prediction.

•	To detect diabetes at an early stage, this project employs machine learning classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K Neighbours, SVM, Decision tree, Random Forest, Bagging Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier are implemented.

•	The Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD) is used in the experiments. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provided the results.
 The accuracy of the algorithms used are compared and discussed. The study's comparison of the various machine learning techniques shows which algorithm is better suited for diabetes prediction. Using machine learning methods, this project aims to assist doctors and physicians in the early detection of diabetes.

Conclusion and Expected Output:
Finally, we have trained our models, and summarized table of the metrics of the various models. Objectives were,
1)	To attempt to see if it is possible to glean any further information from the data to determine correlation between parameters and diabetes.
2)	To attempt to get the best accuracy score using various supervised learning machine learning algorithms.
For the first objective, based on the hypothesis test, we can tell that glucose levels are positively correlated to a person having diabetes, but we are not able to confirm if there is causality. For the second objective, based on the comparison between the various algorithms used, Random Forest seems to produce the best results to me. The aim of this project is to create a model that can reliably predict the accuracy of diabetes in patients. The main aim of this project is to design and implement Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods and Performance Analysis of that methods and it has been achieved successfully. The proposed approach uses various classification and ensemble learning method in which SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic regression and Gradient Boosting classifiers are used. A machine learning algorithm must be used to build a framework that provides reliable results while reducing human effort. The test accuracy of the various models is generally within the same range, from approximately 73% to 81%. Based on Accuracy and Recall score, overly the Random Forest Classifier produced the best results.
Future  Prospects:
•	Machine learning has the great ability to revolutionize the diabetes prediction with the help of advanced computational methods.
•	Detection of Diabetes in its early stage is the key for treatment.
•	The technique may also help researchers to develop an accurate and efficient tool that will reach at the table of clinicians to help them make better decisions about the disease.
